For example, I used the batch size of 32 which is generally used in these tasks. But later, I increased it to 128 to increase the speed of the training. I chose a sequence length of 8 since the scripts are generally shorter than normal texts. So, small number of words might be enough to capture the context of the script. \n",

I also used gradient clipping (threshold = 3) in order to prevent exploding gradient. I set the hidden dimensions to 256 and embedding dimensions to 200 similar to the previous notebooks during the lectures of RNN. Also, I used 2 layers of LSTM cells which is normal for similar tasks. Also, I used LSTM instead of GRU since LSTM is more common for these type of tasks.\n",

Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!"
